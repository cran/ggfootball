## Overview

The ggfootball package provides R functions that scrape shots data from
[understat](https://understat.com/) and visualizes it using interactive
plots:

- A detailed shot map displaying the location, type, and expected goals
  (xG) value of shots taken by both teams.
- An xG timeline chart showing the cumulative expected goals for each
  team over time, annotated with the details of scored goals.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggfootball from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pak("aymennasri/ggfootball")
```

## Example

``` r
library(ggfootball)

# xG chart
xg_chart(match_id = 26631, 
         home_team_color = "red", 
         away_team_color = "grey", 
         competition = "Premier League",
         background_color = "#FFF1E5")

# Shot/xG map
xg_map(match_id = 26631, title = "xG Map")
```
